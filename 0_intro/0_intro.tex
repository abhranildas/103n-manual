This introductory chapter describes some general information you
need to know about how to perform laboratory procedures, how to write a 
lab worksheet and how to
analyze data correctly. Please read these through carefully; your instructor 
will cover these items quickly on the first day of lab, and you should already
be familiar with these ideas before you come to class.

\section{General Lab Procedures}

Physics 103N is a three hour lab designed to be self-contained.
This means that your only homework is to prepare for the next lab.
You {\it must} do this preparation.  
The type of laboratory report you will submit at
the end of the class period is a worksheet lab.  You will fill
out a worksheet as you proceed through the experiment.
You will spend
two hours in lab collecting data and plotting graphs.  At the end of the
second hour, you will move to a classroom and complete your calculations
and discussions for that day's lab and turn in the finished worksheet
to your instructor.    If you are unprepared and unable
to complete the worksheet, you must hand it in by the end of the third hour
anyway.
We designed this format to help you 
focus on the physical meaning of the experiments and avoid sinking into a 
morass of meaningless calculations. 

To help you avoid many hours of tedious number crunching, we have placed 
computers in the lab. You should use these to do most, if not all, of your 
graphing and major numerical manipulations. However, the computer cannot think
for you; you have to assess whether the computer is handing you garbage or if 
the results are reliable. Here are some things to keep in mind about the 
computer
\begin{itemize}
\item  It cannot keep track of units.
\item  It must be taught how to deal with uncertainties.
\item  It will not automatically place error bars on your graphs.
\end{itemize}

You must complete the worksheet by the end of class; therefore, your 
instructor may deem a quiz unnecessary, since you must be prepared to complete
the worksheet on time.  The possibility of a quiz exists, however, so know
the rudiments of the procedure of the day. To prepare, you should read the 
manual over very carefully before you come to class. This means you should 
understand the lab goals and important equations.


\section{Error Estimation and Propagation}

Error is everywhere, and you must not only acknowledge it, but understand it 
and control it. Webster defines ``error'' as the ``difference between 
an observed or calculated value and the true value.'' The problem with this 
definition is that we usually have no idea what the ``true'' answer should be.
Previous experiments or theoretical calculations may give us a clue, but 
somehow we must extract an estimate of the true value from our data. In 
addition, we should also determine to what extent we should take our answer 
seriously. This last point embodies what we call error estimation. 

An example will show why this process is so important. Suppose you measure the
acceleration of a free-falling body and the answer you obtain is $10.5~{\rm
 m/s^2}$. Have you contradicted the accepted value of $9.7990 \pm 0.0014~{\rm
 m/s^2}$? The answer depends on the size of the error in your answer. If your 
result was $10.5 \pm 1.0~{\rm m/s^2}$ then your answer is no, because the 
accepted value lies within your error. If, on the other hand, you had 
performed a fairly precise measurement and obtained $10.5 \pm 0.1~{\rm 
m/s^2}$, then your answer would have to be yes; you should then start looking 
for what went wrong in the experiment itself, since many, many other 
measurements conducted over the last 300 years have established the accepted 
value $9.7990 \pm 0.0014~{\rm m/s^2}$. So, the amount of effort and trust you 
put into an answer depends critically on ascertaining the correct overall 
uncertainty.

Rarely is what you measure directly comparable to other experimental results 
or theoretical calculations; typically, you must process your data through 
various formulas to extract a parameter you can compare with others. 
Therefore, it is critically important to accurately {\em propagate} the 
uncertainties in the original data through the calculations and arrive at a 
reasonable uncertainty for the final value. This is the process of error 
propagation. These are the issues that we now discuss.

\subsection{Definition of Uncertainty}

The first step involved in error estimation is to identify the possible types 
of errors that can occur in your experiment. There are three basic types you 
need to be aware of: illegitimate errors, systematic errors, and random errors. 
Illegitimate errors are faults in experimental procedures or 
calculational blunders. We will make every effort to avoid making these kinds 
of errors, but if we do blunder, we can easily find and correct
them; {\em we will assume that we have eliminated all illegitimate errors 
from our experiments.} This is a formidable assumption since the time to 
perform our experiments is limited; however, the procedures are not all that 
complicated; so this assumption should not be a bad one. Under this assumption
therefore, we cannot use illegitimate errors as reasonable explanations for
any discrepancies that ultimately occur in our analysis. To discuss the other
types of errors, we must more carefully distinguish between accuracy and 
precision.

{\em Accuracy} represents how close a measurement is to the true value. 
{\em Precision} indicates how well the results of an experiment have been 
determined, independently of how well the results agree with the true value.
This tells us about the self-consistency of a measurement. When judging the 
results of an experiment, we must consider both the accuracy and the 
precision. In general, when we quote the uncertainty of an experimental 
result, we are referring to the {\em precision} with which the result has been 
determined.

{\em Systematic errors} are errors that make our results different from  the 
true value in a reproducible way. They are usually due to the faulty 
calibration of equipment or some unknown bias on the part of the experimenter. 
They can be subtle and hard to quantify. Knowledge of the apparatus and the 
experimental procedure is the central manner of minimizing the impact of 
systematic errors in our results. Such errors affect the {\em accuracy} of our 
results, since  they contribute the same amount of discrepancy each time we 
perform the experiment. {\em Random errors}, on the other hand, constitute the 
major source of imprecision in an experiment. These are the random 
fluctuations in measurements from experiment to experiment, primarily due to 
the finite resolution of our apparatus. To control random errors, we must 
perform the experiment many times and use a statistical analysis to extract 
our results. A given accuracy implies at  least an equivalent precision; thus, 
accuracy depends on these fluctuations too.

To clarify the difference between these two types of errors, consider the
simple experiment of determining the average speed of a rolling ball as it
passes by a meter stick, by using a handheld timer. A systematic error
involved in this experiment could be due to the calibration of our instruments.
For instance, assume that the intervals on the meter stick are 1\% larger than
they should. Then, every time we record a distance of 50~cm the actual distance
travelled by the ball is 50.5~cm. The distinct feature of systematic errors,
such as this, is their repeatability. No matter how many times we perform the
same measurement, if we are using the same instrument, we will always make the
same ``mistake.'' Random errors don't share this property. In the rolling ball
experiment a random error is due to the timer operator. No matter how hard he
or she tries, a human operator cannot be entirely consistent on when to press
the start/stop button on the timer. Sometimes, he or she will start the timer
just a little before the ball passes by the predetermined mark on the ruler,
some times a little after. The same thing will happen when it is time to stop
the timer. The end result is that, if we perform many attempts at the
experiment (and assuming that the ball is always launched at the same speed,)
the times we will get will vary randomly around the correct value. A random
error is also introduced by the finite resolution of the devices we are using.
Suppose that we have replaced the timer's human operator with a ``perfect''
photogate setup. If the smallest time increment on our timer is 0.01~s and we
measure a time of 50.23~s then we only know that the actual time is between
50.225~s and 50.235~s. Every value in between these two will be rounded and
displayed on our instrument as 50.23~s. If we perform the measurement many
times and we always get the same reading of 50.23~s, the reasonable thing to
assume is that, in every attempt, the actual time was different, but
within the above-mentioned limits.

We also distinguish between what we call absolute and relative uncertainty.
{\it Absolute uncertainty} is the uncertainty in a quantity expressed in the 
same units as the quantity. For example, if we write
$$ g = 9.7990\pm 0.0014~\mbox{m/s}^2,$$ 
then the absolute uncertainty in the measurement of $g$ is 
$\Delta g=0.0014~\mbox{m/s}^2$.  Note that we always consider the absolute 
uncertainty to be a {\it positive} number. The {\it relative uncertainty} is 
the uncertainty expressed as a fraction or percentage of the quantity.  The 
relative uncertainty of $g$ in our example is 
$$ \frac{\Delta g}{g} = \frac{0.0014~\mbox{m/s}^2}{9.7990~\mbox{m/s}^2}
= 0.00014 = 0.014\%.$$ 

\subsection{Estimating Parameters and Their Uncertainties}
\label{sec:intro:uncert}
Now that we know what constitutes error, we should describe how to estimate 
it given a data set. Let's consider the most common situation in which we 
need to extract an estimate for the error; this occurs when we've made several
measurements of the same quantity and we want to extract an average value and 
a corresponding uncertainty. For concreteness, suppose we have a set of $N$ 
data points $x_i$ with uncertainty $\Delta x_i$ which we do not assume is the 
same for each of the measurements. (We need this generality because the 
uncertainty can vary independently of  the quantity being measured; for 
example, if you measure a current value on two different scales on a meter, 
then the uncertainties of the two measurements are different.) Then you can 
show ({\it c.f.}~Bevington and Robinson, see the Preface for the reference) 
that, assuming a Gaussian error distribution, the {\bf most probable value} is the 
mean, or average, value, $\overline{x}$:
\begin{equation}
\fbox{$ \displaystyle \overline{x} = \frac{\sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{x_i}{(\Delta x_i)^2}}
{ \sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{1}{(\Delta x_i)^2}}. $}   \label{eq:intro:average}
\end{equation}
This formula may look complicated, but all it does is give prominence to those 
measurements with the smallest uncertainty, a very reasonable thing to do. 
Notice that, if all the values have the same uncertainty, $\Delta x_i = \Delta 
x$ for $i=1$ to $N$, this formula reduces to the usual $\overline{x} = (1/N) 
\sum^{N}_{i=1} x_i$.   The corresponding uncertainty in the average value is 
the {\bf standard deviation}, $\sigma$, and comes from  the relation
\begin{equation}
\fbox{$ \displaystyle \frac{1}{\sigma^2} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{(\Delta x_i)^2}. $}
\label{eq:intro:standdev}
\end{equation}
We can see from this formula that the uncertainty of  the combination is 
always less than the smallest uncertainty of the component measurements. We 
should certainly hope so! After all, the more measurements we do, the better 
we should know what the answer is. In the case that all the uncertainties are 
equal to $\Delta x$, this expression reduces to $\sigma = \Delta x / 
\sqrt{N}$, showing that the uncertainty decreases at the relatively slow rate 
of one over the square root of the number of measurements.

Suppose you have three measurements of the resistance of a resistor that have 
come from three different techniques. This data appears in 
Table~\ref{tab:intro:resistance measurements}. The nominal value is the value 
printed on the resistor; the multimeter measurement comes from an ohmmeter 
measurement; and the current and voltage measurements come from a detailed 
analysis using Ohm's law. Each technique has its own associated uncertainty. 
We want to combine these separate measurements into a single estimate of the 
resistance. Since the errors are distributed symmetrically ({\it i.e.}, 
another measurement's value is equally likely to fall on either side of the 
current measurement's value), we can reliably use our formulas based on a 
Gaussian distribution, {\it i.e.}, the ones given above. We find the 
resistance to be
\begin{eqnarray*}
2.5866 \pm 0.0027~{\rm k} \Omega.
\end{eqnarray*}
This answer reflects several general features of these formulas mentioned 
above. First, it is closest to the measurement with the smallest uncertainty. 
Second, the uncertainty of  the combined measurements is less than the 
smallest measured uncertainty, but not by much. This reflects the fact that 
the other measurements' uncertainties were much larger than the last. This is 
good intuition that you should incorporate into your thinking patterns; it 
will help you identify the important sources of error in your experiments.

\end{center}

\end{table}

For more sophisticated experiments, we don't necessarily measure the same 
quantity over and over. We might change one parameter and measure another, to 
investigate the effects of one on the other. When we do this, we are looking 
for correlations between the different parameters. One of the most effective 
ways to spot correlations is to graph the parameters and look for some 
functional relationship. The easiest and most reliable functional relationship 
to recognize and quantify is a linear one, {\it i.e.}, when you plot the 
parameters, the data points fall along a line. In fact, this type of 
correlation is so important that we sometimes alter the parameters that we 
plot to force the graphed data into a line, as in a log-log plot or a semi-log 
plot. Here, we don't just plot the data, but certain functions of the data 
that are linearly related. This can't always be done, but for our labs it can; 
so, we will focus solely on analyzing linear correlations. In this case, the 
correlation between the two quantities is described in terms of two numbers: 
the slope of the line and its $y$-intercept. For most purposes, the slope is 
the more important of the two, but the intercept can also contain important 
physical information. Once the data suggests a linear relationship, we want to 
extract the slope and intercept of the ``best fit'' line.

There are many complicated definitions of  ``best fit'' that one can use to 
extract a consistent slope and intercept from a set of data. The most often 
used method goes by the name of {\em least squares} fit. The reason for the 
popularity of this particular method has to do with its relative simplicity 
and statistical significance. It will provide the slope and intercept of the 
most probable line to fit a set of data, assuming a Gaussian distribution for 
the errors. Thus you can think of this as analogous to extracting the average 
quantity for a larger class of measurements.

We can derive the formulas for the linear least squares fit to a set of data 
with the following assumptions: first, that the uncertainty is symmetrically 
distributed about the data values, and second, the uncertainty in the 
dependent variable is more significant than the uncertainty in the independent 
variable. These assumptions are discussed at length in Bevington and Robinson, 
and we will simply take them for granted. With these assumptions in mind, we 
can proceed as follows: given $N$ data points 
$(x_i,y_i \pm \Delta y_i), i=1,\ldots,N$, we want to determine the parameters 
of the line $y=ax+b$ so that the square of the vertical distance between the 
$y$~coordinates of the line and the data, weighted by the uncertainty 
$\Delta y_i$ and summed over all the data points, is a minimum. The geometry 
of this construction is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:intro:least squares}. That is,
we want to minimize the function of 2~variables
\begin{eqnarray*}
e(a,b) = \sum^{N}_{i=1} \left( \frac{1}{\Delta y_i} (y_i-ax_i-b)\right)^2
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{figure}[!htb]

\caption{The least squares method determines the line that minimizes the 
square of the vertical distances between the line and the data.}
\label{fig:intro:least squares}
\end{figure}
To minimize this function, we take the partial derivatives with respect to $a$ 
and $b$ and set them equal to zero. This yields the following system of linear 
equations for $a$ and $b$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
a \sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{x_i^2}{(\Delta y_i)^2} + b \sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{x_i}
{(\Delta y_i)^2}
& = & \sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{x_i y_i}{(\Delta y_i)^2} \\
a \sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{x_i}{(\Delta y_i)^2} + b \sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{1}
{(\Delta y_i)^2} & = & \sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{y_i}{(\Delta y_i)^2} 
\end{eqnarray*}
Using your favorite technique, you can show that the solution of this linear 
system of equations is
\begin{eqnarray}
a &=&  \frac{1}{D} \left[ 
       \left( \sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{1}{(\Delta y_i)^2}\right) 
       \left( \sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{x_i y_i}{(\Delta y_i)^2} \right) -
       \left( \sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{x_i}{(\Delta y_i)^2} \right)               
       \left( \sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{y_i}{(\Delta y_i)^2} \right) \right],
\nonumber \\
b &=&  \frac{1}{D}  \left[ 
       \left( \sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{x_i^2}{(\Delta y_i)^2} \right)
       \left( \sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{y_i}{(\Delta y_i)^2} \right) -
       \left( \sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{x_i}{(\Delta y_i)^2} \right)
       \left( \sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{x_i y_i}{(\Delta y_i)^2} \right) \right],
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{equation}
D = \left( \sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{1}{(\Delta y_i)^2} \right)
         \left( \sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{x_i^2}{(\Delta y_i)^2} \right) -
         \left( \sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{x_i}{(\Delta y_i)^2} \right)^2.
\end{equation}
The corresponding uncertainties in the fit parameters are
\begin{eqnarray}
(\Delta a)^2 &=& \frac{1}{D} \sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{1}{(\Delta y_i)^2},
\nonumber \\
(\Delta b)^2 &=& \frac{1}{D} \sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{x_i^2}{(\Delta y_i)^2}.
\end{eqnarray}

Let's take a look at these equations in action. Consider the data given in 
Table~\ref{tab:intro:current voltage data}; this data came from current and 
voltage measurements across a resistor of unknown resistance. Ohm's law 
indicates that, for most resistors, the voltage is linearly related to the 
current, the proportionality constant being the resistance. We've plotted this 
data in Figure~\ref{fig:intro:current voltage plot}, which strongly suggests a 
linear relationship between current and voltage. So, it makes sense to apply 
our least squares equations directly to the current-voltage data. Considering 
the data again, we see that the errors appear symmetrically distributed around 
each point, and the independent variable's (the current's) uncertainty is much 
smaller than the corresponding uncertainty in the voltage data. So, this data 
satisfies both conditions for applying the least squares analysis.

We find (and you should verify with units!) the following values for the sums 
involved:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum^{10}_{i=1} \frac{x_i}{(\Delta y_i)^2} & = & 1.5212 \cdot 10^6\\
\sum^{10}_{i=1} \frac{y_i}{(\Delta y_i)^2} & = & 4.4578 \cdot 10^6\\
\sum^{10}_{i=1} \frac{x_i^2}{(\Delta y_i)^2} & = & 7.0201 \cdot 10^5\\
\sum^{10}_{i=1} \frac{x_i y_i}{(\Delta y_i)^2} & = & 2.0107 \cdot 10^6\\
\sum^{10}_{i=1} \frac{1}{(\Delta y_i)^2} & = & 4.0600 \cdot 10 ^6
\end{eqnarray*}
from which we find $D = 5.3607 \cdot 10 ^{11}$ and then
\begin{eqnarray*}
a = 2.5785 \pm 0.0028~{\rm k}\Omega\\
b = 0.1319 \pm 0.0011~{\rm V}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{figure}

\noindent The line with this slope and intercept is the line drawn in 
Figure~\ref{fig:intro:current voltage plot}. We see that this line is a very 
good representation of the data. Working through the units,  the slope is in 
k$\Omega$ and the intercept is in V. This calculation is the source of the last
entry in Table~\ref{tab:intro:resistance measurements}. The intercept has an 
interesting interpretation here. It is not zero, since the average value is 
bigger than the error. This means that if we put the current to zero, we would 
still measure a voltage across the resistor. This fact should make us very 
suspicious about any other conclusions we might make from this data, until we 
have an explanation for this apparent contradiction of Ohm's law.

\subsection{Propagating and Reporting Uncertainties}
\label{sec:intro:reprtun}
At this point, you should have a clear idea of what uncertainty is and how to 
estimate it in some simple cases. Once you have your estimates of the
parameters of interest and their uncertainties, you will likely want to run
them through some formulas to arrive at numbers you can compare to other
people's measurements. This brings us to discuss the propagation of
uncertainties through functions and formulas.

To keep things simple, we will make the assumption that the uncertainties in
your parameters are symmetrically distributed about the average and that the
parameters are independent of each other. That is, two measurements of
different parameters are uncorrelated. This is not always true; for example,
in an ideal gas at fixed pressure, the density and temperature fluctuations
are linked by the equation of state. However, the added complications needed
to account for these effects are typically intimately tied to the physical
system you're studying, making a general treatment cumbersome. By ignoring
correlations and assuming symmetry, we can reduce all the necessary error
propagation down to some simple calculus.

Suppose we have a parameter with its uncertainty: $x \pm \Delta x$. The 
question we want to answer is ``What is the uncertainty of some function, $f$,
of this data?'' Under our assumptions, the answer comes from the Taylor 
series expansion of $f$ ({\it c.f.}~Bevington and Robinson): 
$f(x + \Delta x) = f(x) + f^\prime(x) \Delta x + O(\Delta x ^2)$. From this we 
find the uncertainty $\Delta f$ in the function value $f(x)$ is
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta f = \left| \frac{df}{dx} \Delta x \right|,
\end{eqnarray*}
with the derivative evaluated at the point $x$. We can generalize this result 
to functions of several variables as follows: given the data $x \pm \Delta x, 
y \pm \Delta y, \ldots$,  the function $f(x,y,\ldots)$ has the associated 
uncertainty
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta f = \left| \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \Delta x \right| +
           \left| \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \Delta y \right| + \ldots,
\end{eqnarray*}
where all the derivatives are evaluated at the point $x,y,\ldots$. If we recall
that we defined absolute uncertainties to be positive, we can write this as
\begin{equation}
 \fbox{$ \displaystyle \Delta f = \left| \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \right| \Delta x +
           \left| \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right| \Delta y + \ldots, $}
\label{equ:diff:uncertainty}
\end{equation}
From  this relationship, we can derive all the familiar results of error 
propagation.\\
\\
\noindent {\bf Example:}  {\bf Addition and Subtraction} \\
Given: $f(x,y) = 3x+y-z+5$ \\
Find:  $\Delta f$ \\
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta  f & = & \left| \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \right| \Delta x +
           \left| \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right| \Delta y +
            \left| \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \right| \Delta z \\
 & = & \left|3 \right| \Delta x +  \left| 1  \right| \Delta y +\left|-1\right| \Delta z \\  
 & = & 3 \Delta x + \Delta y + \Delta z
\end{eqnarray*}
\noindent
{\bf Example:}  {\bf Multiplication and Division} \\
Given: $f(x,y) = x^2y/(5z)$ \\
Find:  $\Delta f$ \\
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta  f & = & \left| \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \right| \Delta x +
           \left| \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right| \Delta y +
            \left| \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \right| \Delta z \\
& = & \left|2 x y/ (5z)\right| \Delta x +  \left| x^2/(5z) \right| \Delta y +
\left|-x^2y/(5z^2)\right| \Delta z 
\end{eqnarray*}
\noindent  {\bf Example:}  {\bf Ohm's Law}\\
Given: $V = IR $ \\
Find:  $\Delta R$ \\
 \begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta R  & = & \left| \frac{\partial R}{\partial V} \right| \Delta V +
           \left| \frac{\partial R}{\partial I} \right| \Delta I \\
  & = & \left| \frac{1}{I} \right| \Delta(V) + \left| \frac{-V}{I^2} \right| \Delta I
\end{eqnarray*}

Now that we have a clear idea of  what constitutes  the uncertainty of a 
measurement, how to estimate it, and how to propagate it, we should talk about
the proper way to report the uncertainty of a measurement. This forms the 
subject of {\it significant figures}. Here is how you should determine the 
number of significant figures:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate the uncertainty in the quantity.
\item Round off the uncertainty to one or two digits.
\item Express the uncertainty in the same units as the quantity measured.
\item Round off the quantity to the last decimal place of the uncertainty.
\item Always write down the final result of a calculation with the uncertainty
and the units included.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Use the form
\begin{center}
$(2.34 \pm 0.23) \cdot 10^3$ m, or $2.34 \pm 0.23$ km,
\end{center}
{\it not} expressions such as
\begin{eqnarray*}
2.34 \cdot 10^3~{\rm m} \pm 0.23 \cdot 10^3~{\rm m},\\
2.34~{\rm km} \pm 23 \cdot10^1~{\rm m},\\
2340~{\rm m} \pm 0.23 \cdot 10^3~{\rm m}.
\end{eqnarray*}
These are the rules you will use most often in reporting your results. They 
become rather cumbersome, though, when you begin to make very precise 
measurements. Consider, for example, the charge on the electron; the best 
measurement we have of this number is
\begin{eqnarray*}
(1.60217733 \pm 0.00000049) \cdot 10^{-19}~{\rm C}.
\end{eqnarray*}
This is very annoying; so, we've developed a shorthand for reporting these 
kinds of measurements. You simply quote the result to the known uncertainty and
place the uncertainty of the last few digits in parentheses after the number 
and before the power of ten. In this notation, the electron's charge is
\begin{eqnarray*}
1.60217733(49) \cdot 10^{-19}~{\rm C},
\end{eqnarray*}
which is much easier to deal with. If you begin to make measurements of such 
precision that you need to employ this convention, feel free to do so.

Finally, in various experiments we quote what are called ``accepted values''
for various physical parameters. These are the scientific community's best 
estimates of these numbers. They have been experimentally verified and checked 
for consistency with other measurements. Most you will find are very precise, 
typically 6 or 7 decimal places. You will discover in trying to do your own 
labs that making such high precision measurements is not easy. They also let 
you know that there is still some uncertainty in these parameters; they are
not {\em exact}; but you will probably not be able to help narrow that using 
the equipment and techniques we have, which means they are exact as far as we 
can tell. So, keep in mind as you attempt to verify these numbers, that other 
folks had to do these measurements too.  

\section{The Lab Worksheet}

The lab worksheets are preformated to be well organized, concise, and 
complete.  The worksheets are designed to maximize
your efficiency.  The format of the worksheets includes the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item  In-Lab Procedure \\
\item  In-Lab Computer Work \\
\item  Pre-Classroom Checklist \\
\item  In-Classroom Calculations \& Analysis \\
\item  In-Classroom Discussion  and Conclusion \\
\end{itemize}
Each item is described in detail below.  Some may occur more than once in any 
given worksheet.

\subsection{In-Lab Procedure}

The In-Lab Procedure section will guide you through experimental
set-up, data collection, and necessary calculations.  This section
will always be the first section of the worksheet, but there may be a
few of them in any one worksheet.  Each time you set-up a new
experiment in that day's lab, a new in-lab procedure section will
guide you.  Since this lab is electronics and optics, you will be
connecting circuits and manipulating optical equipment.  Figures are
provided and numbered to show you how to make connections and
placements for these set-ups.  The figures will become your friends in
setting up the experiments.  {\bf Do not ignore them}.  You cannot set-
up without the figures.  
 
After setting up the experiment, you will follow the directions given
to begin data collecting.  Sometimes you will be obtaining one piece
of data, other times twenty.  Any data collecting will be specified
and organized by a table or space.  Blank spaces above answers are to
be used by you to {\bf show your work} in reaching the answer below
the space.  This is {\bf very important} as indicated by the {\bf
boldface}.  Boldface will appear when an important point is being made
vital to your grade.  

When you are recording your data, be that in a table or
on a line, you should present your raw data neatly and completely
including {\bf units}, uncertainties, and significant digits.  Any
calculations used in recording the data should be shown in the space
provided above the answer.  Show all calculations {\it keeping numbers
out of the calculations until the final step}.  How to do the
calculations will be explained in the In-Classroom Calculations \&
Analysis section. 

When showing your work, it is crucial that you {\it propagate} all units 
and uncertainties through the algebra. This will convince the reader
that you're not trying to hide anything and it will help you check
your answers as you go.  Do not ignore units for several steps of a
computation and then just write down what seems to be the proper
units; you can loose many factors of 10 by not doing this. 

Before moving on to the next section of the worksheet, 
double check that you have completed everything required of you.  
Remember that this section is not only for data recording.  Just because 
there is no space for an answer does not mean there was nothing important
to be done.  You must complete everything in each section before moving on
to the next one.  You and your lab partner can divide the work to be more
efficient but make sure you do everything. 

\subsection{In-Lab Computer Work} 
After collecting and recording data you will usually make a graph.
You are not plotting the data to make more work for yourselves.  The
graphs will give you a vital piece of information that you will use in 
calculations,
analysis, discussion or conclusion.  Graphing is usually the easiest
and most accurate way to get the information.  You will be using the computers
in lab, and that means that you must complete all the graphs in the two hour
lab time.  You will need them for the classroom period.   

KaleidaGraph is the plotting program you will be using for all 
your graphs.  You will spend part of the first two lab sections
learning and practicing your KaleidaGraph skills.  You need to become 
proficient in KaleidaGraph to complete the labs   
since you will include all graphs with your worksheet before leaving lab.
You should title your graphs appropriately, include
all units, and label axes.  Despite the fact that the computer will be
doing most of the work in graphing your data, you need to understand
what the work entails.  

In many labs you will have to graph sets of 5 to 15 data points 
and make 
linear fits to the data. If you graph by hand, as you will in 
$\S$~\ref{sec:ea:graph}, you should use graph paper of at least 4 boxes per 
inch and each graph should be large and clear. A full
page graph of 10 points is not unreasonable. The scales on the axes should be 
appropriate for the data ranges, so that the data covers most of the graph. 
Having bunched up data points leads to difficulty in reading the graph and 
loss of precision in fitting lines and calculating slopes and intercepts. Do 
not draw your axes across a full page and choose your scale in such a way that 
the data points occupy only a few cm$^2$! Also, take care to distinguish 
dependent and independent variables when graphing; the quantity which is the 
function of the other in the experiment is conventionally plotted along the 
vertical axis. If you are asked to plot $y$ vs. $x$, for example, you should 
interpret $y$ as the dependent variable and plot it on the vertical axis. 
Always label the axes with their appropriate physical parameters and include 
the correct units in the label.

When fitting data by hand, as opposed to the least squares method discussed 
earlier, be sure not to obscure any data points and do not ``connect the 
dots.'' Doing so has no physical basis and yields no insight into the physics 
at hand. Using a straight edge, ``eyeball'' the line that best fits the data.
This line will yield the best values for the slope and intercept of your fit.
Furthermore, you should draw the steepest and shallowest lines that 
are consistent with both the trend of your data and with the error bars. 
These lines will yield the uncertainty in your fit parameters, through the
formulae
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta a &=& \frac{|a_{\mbox{steep}}-a_{\mbox{shallow}}|}{2} \\
\Delta b &=& \frac{|b_{\mbox{steep}}-b_{\mbox{shallow}}|}{2}.
\end{eqnarray*}
Remember that these lines represent the trend present in your data and might 
not pass through any data points. When calculating slopes for these lines, you 
want to choose two points on the lines that are not data points. The trend of 
the line is far more important than the slope between any two data points. 

Although these instructions tell how to estimate the best fit line by hand, the
computer is only doing a more sophisticated and reproducible version of this; 
thus, to fully employ the computer's power, you need to understand how to 
estimate these things independently of the computer. This will also help you 
check the results the computer gives you.

\subsection{Pre-Classroom Checklist}
The checklist is included for you to use as a check against what you have
to take out of the lab period.  You only have 2 hours in lab during which
time you may do several procedures and graphs.  Before leaving the laboratory, 
you will use this list to see that you have completed everything and have it
with you to take to the classroom.  Once you leave the lab, another class
enters it so you can't go back to use the computers or redo a portion of the 
lab.  The worksheet has been designed to be completed in parts.  You
will complete one procedure and do its computer work before moving on to 
the next procedure.  In this manner, you will be able to do a complete
analysis and discussion on at least some parts even if you don't finish
the lab.  

There are $\bigcirc$ provided for you to physically check off.  Do this.
It will keep you organized when you get to the classroom.  One hour
is not a lot of time to finish all the calculations, discussions, and 
conclusion.  Also make sure that each partner has her/his own data,
graphs, tracings, etc..  Contact amongst you will be kept to a minimum.


\subsection{In-Classroom Calculations \& Analysis}
At this point you have finished all In-Lab Procedures and In-Lab 
Computer Work.  You have also checked all the circles in the
{\bf check list} to ensure that you have completed all the laboratory
work.  Once the two hour lab period is over, you will move to the
classroom and finish the worksheet in {\bf one hour}.  If you
complete all in-lab sections sooner than two hours you may begin
the in-classroom sections.  

The calculations you need to do are clearly stated with referenced
equations, figures, and tables when appropriate.  There is a line
or space left for each answer.  There is also room for you to 
{\bf show your work}.  You must show all the steps and reasoning behind
your answers to get full credit.  A sample calculation is done for you
here as a future guide.  Suppose the question in the in-classroom 
calculation \& analysis section reads: \\
\vspace*{0.3cm}  \\
\noindent \hspace*{1cm} Calculate the resistance through a circuit given the 
voltage, $V$ = \\
\hspace*{1.2cm}5.00 $\pm$ 0.01 $V$, and current, $I$ = 20.0 $\pm$ 0.2 $mA$, 
with uncertainties \\
\hspace*{1.2cm}and units.  {\bf Show Work}. \\
\begin{eqnarray*}
V & = & IR \\
R & = &  \frac{V}{I}  \\
R  & = &  \frac{5 \> V}{20\>mA} \\ 
R  & = &  250\> \Omega \\
\Delta R  & = & \left| \frac{1}{I} \right| \Delta(V) + \left| \frac{-V}{I^2} \right| \Delta I\\
\Delta R   & = & \left| \frac{1}{20 \> mA} \right| 0.01 \> V + \left| \frac{-5 \> V}{400 \> (mA)^2} \right| 0.2 \> mA \\
\Delta R  & = &  3 \> \Omega \\
R  & = & 250 \pm 3 \> \Omega 
\end{eqnarray*}
\noindent The above is what you should show and report.  Note that
numbers were not used until the last line of each calculation and
the uncertainties were treated separately from the values.  You will
be performing this calculation later in lab.  

The In-Classroom Calculation \& Analysis sections can also
ask questions that lead you to an understanding of the reasoning behind
the lab and the physical principles that the lab confirms.  They are rarely
in yes/no format.  Answer all the questions completely, stating
your reasoning leading to the answer and showing any calculations or
drawings necessary.  At the end of this section you should understand
all aspects of the lab well enough to write a concluding statement.

\subsection{In-Classroom Discussion and Conclusion}
In the final section you will bring all your analysis 
together to answer questions and make 
specific, concrete conclusions about the parameters and physics developed in 
the lab. This includes a clear statement of the results of the lab, 
{\it e.g.}~parameters that you've measured including units and uncertainty, 
comments on the physical implications of these parameters, etc. You should 
indicate whether your results are consistent with previous efforts and discuss 
the internal consistency of your experiment. You should candidly address the 
uncertainties that arose in the lab and attempt to unambiguously and uniquely 
identify the key source of error. Within the paradigm that we discussed before,
this cannot include things like ``human error'' or ``errors in the 
calculations.'' You should have these illegitimate errors tightly under 
control. With all these ideas clearly laid out, you should then state whether 
you believe the experiment to be a success or not, justifying yourself by 
referring to your previous discussions.

Your instructor may also assign additional questions for you to ponder. You 
should incorporate the answers to these questions into your discussion. They 
should fall naturally into your considerations, as you think about what might 
have gone wrong, or possible sources of discrepancy that were not in the 
original motivating theory. Typically, these questions have direct answers, 
but only after you have thought about the lab. 

\section{Using KaleidaGraph for Data Analysis}
\label{sec:hypoexp}
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{What KaleidaGraph Does and Doesn't}

The software package known as KaleidaGraph can be a useful tool for
data analysis. Of course, it will only be useful if you learn how to
tell it to do what you want it to do. This knowledge is best acquired
by experience with using the software, and you will get plenty of that
in the upcoming semester. That fact doesn't help you at the moment,
though. Getting started is the difficult part.  Hopefully, this
section will help you with that.

This section is not meant to be a detailed guide to using
KaleidaGraph. Instead, it hopes to demonstrate how to use those
features of KaleidaGraph which will be most useful to you: plotting
and fitting curves to data. To accomplish this, this section
is designed to be a working example.

When you are using KaleidaGraph to analyze real data, you'll probably
have to perform most of the tasks described below. In that spirit,
we'll connect all the examples with\ldots

\subsubsection{\ldots A Hypothetical Experiment.}

Suppose an experiment has been performed that tests the well-known
conjecture that the probability that a slice of toast buttered on one
side will fall butter-side-up is inversely proportional to the value
of the carpet on which it falls. This assertion can be represented by
an equation:

$$ U = a{1 \over V}, $$ where $U$ represents the probability of a piece
of bread falling butter side up, $a$ is a proportionality constant,
and $V$ is the price of the carpet in U.S. dollars. If you were to
somehow measure the probabilities of the toast falling butter-side-up
on several carpets, and plot these against the reciprocal of the price
of the carpet, you'd expect to see a straight line, with a slope equal
to the proportionality constant.  The following examples will lead you
through the process of plotting data taken in such an experiment and
finding the slope of the best fit line of the plot.

Now for some details. On each run of the experiment, a helicopter
dropped 100,000 slices of buttered toast on a large sample of
carpet. Then, the U.S. Dept. of Parks and Wildlife flew in with their
own helicopter to take an aerial photograph of the result. From the
photograph, the fraction of butter-side-up slices was measured, and
reported as the probability.\footnote{These results have met with
some controversy. The Association of Premium Carpet Manufacturers has
filed a lawsuit claiming that the results have been altered to make
their products seem less desirable.} Only five runs were accomplished
before funding ran out. The results of the experiment are
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
$V (\$)$ & $U$ \\ $100 \pm 1$ & $0.43 \pm 0.01$ \\ $250 \pm 1$ & $0.15
\pm 0.01$ \\ $500 \pm 2$ & $0.09 \pm 0.01$ \\ $750 \pm 2$ & $0.06 \pm
0.01$ \\ $1000 \pm 3$ & $0.04 \pm 0.01$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}  


\subsection {Entering Data}
\subsubsection {Actually Entering Data}

KaleidaGraph holds data in a {\bf data window.} One of these should
appear when you start; it's default name is {\bf Data 1.} To enter
data,

\noindent
\begin{enumerate}
\item Activate the data window by clicking on it.
\item Position the cursor on the cell you want to enter data into.
\item Type in a piece of data. 
\item Move to another cell using mouse, arrow keys, Tab or Return.
\end{enumerate}
Enter all the Buttered Toast data, entering values for $V$ in column ``A'',
the uncertainties for $V$ in column ``B'', the values for $U$ in column ``C'' 
and the uncertainties for $U$ in column ``D''.

\indent

Note that KaleidaGraph plots data in a column vs. column fashion, so
the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of a single piece of data should be
placed in the same row, but different columns.

\subsubsection{Renaming Columns of Data}

This might not seem important at first, but KaleidaGraph labels the
axes on plots with the name of the columns it used in the plot. The
default names of columns are ``A'', ``B'', ``C'', etc. These appear in
the {\bf column title} row of the data window, along with a number. To
change the name of the column,

\noindent
\begin{enumerate}
\item Double-click on the column title you wish to change.
\item In the ``Column Format:" dialog box which appears there will be a list of column 
titles. Highlight the title you wish to alter by clicking on it.
\item Type in the new title of the column (for example ``A'' becomes $V(\$)$).
\item When you are finished changing names, click on the button labeled 
{\bf Done.}
\end{enumerate}
Make sure to name each column, include uncertainties (for example
``B'' becomes $dV(\$)$).  Don't forget the units!
\indent

The number of any column can be set to zero merely by clicking on the
title cell of that column. The columns to the right then take the
numbers 1, 2, 3.... The columns to the left become unnumbered.

\subsection{Entering Formulas}

Often, the raw data you enter is not immediately in the form you need
for plotting.  Never fear, KaleidaGraph is capable of performing
mathematical operations on the numbers you have entered. One way of
using this feature is to define a formula for KaleidaGraph. Formulas
tell KaleidaGraph to put in one column the result of operations on
data in other columns.

The syntax of formulas you define should be
\begin{center}
c$x$ = f(c$y$, c$z$, ...)
\end{center}
where $x, y,$ and $z$ are the numbers of the columns which contain the
numbers you wish to operate on, and f(...) is the mathematical
expression you wish KaleidaGraph to calculate.

For example, since you want to plot $U$ vs. $1/V$,
you need to make a column containing
the reciprocal dollar values of the carpets.  
To actually enter and execute a formula,

\noindent
\begin{enumerate}
\item From the {\bf Windows} menu at the top of the screen, select the option {\it
Formula Entry.}
\item In the ``Formula Entry'' window which appears, click on one of the buttons 
labeled {\bf F1 - F8.}
\item Type in the formula in the space provided in the ``Formula Entry'' window (in your case, c4 = 1/c0).
\item Click the button marked Run in the ``Formula Entry'' window.
\end{enumerate}
\indent

The button labeled {\bf F1-F8} you choose corresponds to one of the
function keys at the top of the keyboard. Pressing that key will bring
up the ``Formula Entry'' window again, this time containing the
formula you defined {\bf thus saving important formulas for you}. Make 
sure to rename the column you just made.

Of course, the uncertainties in $1/V$ are different from the
uncertainties in $V.$ So you'll need to get KaleidaGraph to calculate
an uncertainty column for you. Try to figure out the necessary formula
yourself.

\subsection{Plotting Data}

\subsubsection{Making a Scatter Plot}
These two sections on plotting and fitting data require little
motivation. But a few important notes will be made. First, {\bf Never}
connect-the-dots when you plot data.  Fortunately, if you follow these
steps, you'll never forget and accidentally do it.

\noindent
\begin{enumerate}
\item Activate the window containing the data you want to plot by clicking on it.
\item From the {\bf Gallery} menu at the top of the screen, select the {\bf Linear}
submenu, and from that select the {\bf Scatter} option.
\item A dialog box will appear. In it, there will be columns of circles labeled ``X"
and ``Y." Under ``X" click on the circle in the row containing the
title of the column which contains the x-coordinates of your data. A
solid black circle should appear.
\item Do the same with your y-coordinates in the column labeled ``Y."
\item Click on the button labeled {\bf New Plot.}
\end{enumerate}
\indent

Note the conspicuous lack of error bars.

\subsubsection{Adding Error Bars}

\noindent
\begin{enumerate}
\item Activate the window containing your plot by clicking on it.
\item From the {\bf Plot} menu at the top of the screen, select the option ``Error
bars..."
\item In the ``Error Bar Variables" dialog box which appears, click on the square
labeled ``X Err.''
\item Click and hold on one of the two rectangles labeled ``\% of values," and select
the option ``Data Column."
\item Select the column which contains the uncertainties in the x-coordinates of your
plotted data.
\item Click on button labeled {\bf OK.}
\item Now, follow the same procedure starting with the square labeled ``Y Err.''
\item Click on button labeled {\bf Plot.}
\end{enumerate}
\indent

\subsection{Performing a Weighted Least-Squares Fit on Plotted Data}
\subsubsection{Weighted Fit}

We come to the moment of truth. Both the slope and y-intercept of a
linear plot are often important pieces of information to obtain. Of
course, they are meaningless without uncertainties. Therefore, you
should make sure you take into account the uncertainties in your
points when calculating the fit.

\noindent
\begin{enumerate}
\item Activate the window containing your plot by clicking on it.
\item From the {\bf Curve Fit} Menu at the top of the screen, select the {\bf General}
submenu, and from that, select the option {\bf fit1.}
\item In the ``Curve Fit Selections:" dialog box which appears, click on the button
labeled {\bf Define...}
\item In the new dialog box that appears, click on the square labeled ``Weight Data"
so that an X appears in it.
\item Click on the button labeled {\bf OK.}
\item In the ``Curve Fit Selections:" dialog box, click on the square next to the
column title which contains the error in the
y-coordinate of the data you are
plotting.
\item A new dialog box will appear called ``Weight Data From Column:". By clicking on
the buttons labeled $\ll$ and $\gg$ , make sure the name of the
column containing the uncertainties for the y-coordinate appears in
the window.
\item Click on the button labeled {\bf OK}.
\item Now click on this button window's labeled {\bf OK}.
\end{enumerate}
\indent

Now you need the numerical results of the fit. Simply choose the
``Display Equations" option from the {\bf Plot} menu, and a table
containing the numbers you desire will appear. Note that, in this
table, m1 is the y-intercept and m2 is the slope of the best fit line.

\subsubsection{The Work You Should Turn In}

After you have followed through the above example, you should attach
the printout you have made to the worksheet that follows. This printout 
should at least contain:
properly labeled axes, x and y error bars, and the best fit line
plotted by KaleidaGraph through your plotted points. Also, somewhere
on the page below the plot, you should report {\it in a complete
sentence} what you have found to be the constant of proportionality
(with uncertainty!). \\

\noindent Of course, your TA may require more of you.

\section{Error Analysis Worksheet}
{\bf \Large Name:}~ \rule{5cm}{.1mm}~~~~~~~
{\bf \Large Day/Time:}~\rule{3cm}{.1mm}\\

\noindent
{\bf Instructions}: Perform all of the following 
calculations using the techniques explained in 
Chapter~0 (Introduction) of the lab manual. Show all calculations explicitly, 
propagate uncertainties where appropriate, include the proper number of 
significant figures, and provide units. 

\subsection{In-Lab Procedure}

Perform the KaleidaGraph practice plot and analysis in the previous
section $\S$~\ref{sec:hypoexp} and attach it the end of this worksheet.

\subsection{In-Classroom Calculations}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Four independent measurements 
of the voltage supplied by 
a certain D-cell battery were made:
\vspace*{-5mm}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c}
$2.4\pm 0.6$~\mbox{V} \\
$2.96\pm 0.08$~\mbox{V} \\ 
$3.02\pm 0.06$~\mbox{V} \\ 
$2.968\pm 0.004$~\mbox{V}.
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\vspace*{-3mm}
Referring to $\S$~\ref{sec:intro:uncert}, calculate the {\it most probable value}  of the D-cell voltage as well as the
standard deviation of the measurements using equations (\ref{eq:intro:average})
and (\ref{eq:intro:standdev}).  Write your answer as you would report the
final result. \\
\vspace*{5cm}\\

\pagebreak
\item Refer to $\S$~\ref{sec:intro:reprtun} for the calculation and 
propagation of uncertainty.
Two lengths have been measured to be $L_1 = 4.8 \pm 1.2$~cm 
and $L_2 = 3.2 \pm 1.6$~cm. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate the sum $L=L_1+L_2$ and its {\it absolute} uncertainty, 
$\Delta L$. \\
\vspace*{2cm} \\
\noindent Use these to calculate the {\it relative} uncertainty in $L$. \\
\vspace*{2cm} \\

\item Calculate the difference $L_0=L_1-L_2$, as well as its absolute and
relative uncertainties. \\
\vspace*{2cm} \\
\noindent Compare these uncertainties with those in the sum. \\
\vspace*{2cm} \\

\item Now calculate the product $P = L_1 L_2$ and its absolute and relative
uncertainties. \\
\vspace*{2cm} \\

\item Calculate the quotient $Q=L_1/L_2$, its absolute and relative
uncertainties. \\
\vspace*{2cm} \\
\noindent Compare the uncertainties to those in the product. \\
\vspace*{2cm} \\

\item Express $L$, $L_0$, $P$, and $Q$ in proper form, i.e. with units and 
uncertainties.  \\
\vspace*{3cm} \\
\end{enumerate}

\item The area of a square has been measured to be $A=50\pm 6$~cm$^2$. What is
the length of one side of the square?  \\
\vspace*{2cm} \\

\item Two resistors, with resistances $R_1=540\pm 54~\Omega$ and

\label{sec:ea:graph}
\subsection{In-Lab Computer Work}
\subsubsection{Two Exercises for Kaleidagraph}
\noindent
{\bf 1.} Imagine that you are riding in a car with your uncle Bob, his sister 
Sandy, and your cousins Rob and Gary. As you head down a back road in 
central Florida, a brilliant blue light suddenly bathes the car, and you
fall unconscious. When you wake up, you find yourself in a room with no 
doors and plain grey walls. An unknown source of illumination allows you
to see that your only company is a spark-tape apparatus, familiar to you
from your first semester lab class. You immediately realize that you can
conduct a simple experiment to determine the gravitational acceleration of 
the planet you are on. You conduct the experiment and find the following
distance fallen versus time data:

\vspace*{0.5cm}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Distance $(d)$ vs. time $(t)$ Measurements} \\
\hline\hline
$d$ (m) & $t$ (s) \\
\hline
  $.20 \pm .01$      &   $.2 \pm .02$   \\
\hline    
  $.80 \pm .04$      &   $.4 \pm .02$   \\
\hline
  $1.72 \pm .05$     &   $.6 \pm .02$   \\
\hline
  $3.16\pm .05$     &  $.8 \pm .02$    \\
\hline
  $4.84 \pm .10$     &  $ 1.0 \pm .02$    \\
\hline
  $6.96 \pm .10$      & $ 1.2 \pm .02$     \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\vspace*{0.5cm}
\noindent
Do the following

{\it a)} Plot $d$ vs. $t^2$ and obtain a {\bf weighted} least squares fit.
(Remember, use {\bf fit1} under the General option of the curve fit menu.)
Error bars, properly labeled axes and units are essential!  All partners 
should have their own plots.  {\bf Show}
your work in finding $\Delta(t^2)$ below. \\
\vspace*{2cm} \\

{\it b)} Determine the acceleration due to gravity from the results of 
your curve fit, including
units and uncertainties. Show work. \\
\vspace*{2cm} \\

\hspace{4cm}$g=$\rule{4.0cm}{.1mm}\\

{\it c)} Try to guess where you are.... \\
\vspace*{0.8cm} \\

\noindent
{\bf 2.} In an experiment you will conduct in a few weeks, you will measure
the voltage $(V)$ of a discharging capacitor as a function of time $(t).$
You will be required
to plot 

$$
\ln \left( {V \over V_0} \right) \quad vs. \quad t
$$

\noindent
where $V_0$ is the initial voltage (that is, the voltage measured at time 
$t=0.)$

\noindent
Use the following sample data:


\vspace*{0.5cm}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Voltage $(V)$ vs. time $(t)$ Measurements} \\
\hline\hline
$V$ (V) & $t$ (ms) \\
\hline
  $4.0 \pm .10$      &   $ 0.0 \pm .02$   \\
\hline    
  $3.6 \pm .10$      &   $ 1.0 \pm .02$   \\
\hline
  $3.4 \pm .10$     &   $ 2.2 \pm .02$   \\
\hline
  $2.8 \pm .10$     &   $ 3.2 \pm .02$    \\
\hline
  $2.6 \pm .10$     &   $3.8 \pm .02$    \\
\hline
  $2.4 \pm .10$      & $5.0 \pm .02$     \\
\hline

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\vspace*{0.5cm}
\noindent
Do the following

{\it a)} Plot $\ln (V / V_0)$ vs. $t$ and obtain a {\bf weighted} least
squares fit. Again, be sure to include error bars, units, and properly
labeled axes.  Remember, all partners must have their own plots.  
Show your work in finding $\Delta( \ln (V / V_0))$. \\
\vspace*{3cm} \\

{\it b)} Report the slope and intercept of your plot.
Units and uncertainties are a must! \\
\begin{table}[htb]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
Slope & Intercept \\
\hline
\hspace*{5cm} & \hspace*{5cm} \\
& \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Slope and Intercept }
\end{table}

\subsection{In-Classroom Calculation \& Analysis}

\noindent This half of the worksheet is your only
practice in graphing by hand.  You will be using KaleidaGraph
to do all your graphing in Physics 103N.  Before using KaleidaGraph 
indiscriminately, first you will learn what graphing and least squares 
is all about.  Chapter~0 in the lab manual contains all the information
required to do this worksheet, refer back to the appropriate sections. \\

\noindent In Lab~2 (Electron Dynamics), we will learn that an electron 
moving in a 
constant electric potential~$V$ and a constant magnetic field~$B$ 
(perpendicular to the electron's motion), moves in a circular path of radius 
$R$, given by the formula
\begin{equation}
\fbox{$ \displaystyle R^2=\frac{2Vm}{eB^2}, $} \label{eq:1st:elect}
\end{equation}
where $m$ and $e$ are the mass and charge of the electron, respectively.\\

\subsubsection{Hand-fit Graphing}
\noindent A former group of 103N students set the magnetic field 
on their apparatus to
$B=1.154\pm 0.006$~mT (1~T = 1~Tesla = 1~kg/C~s) and measured the path radius
while varying the potential $V$:\\
\ \\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
$V$~(V) & $R$~(cm) \\
\hline
$400\pm 2$ & $5.6\pm 0.4$ \\
$600\pm 2$ & $7.4\pm 0.4$ \\
$800\pm 2$ & $8.2\pm 0.4$ \\
$1000\pm 2$ & $9.0\pm 0.4$ \\
$1200\pm 2$ & $10.2\pm 0.4$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}  
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Plot $R^2$ versus $V$, including error bars on all points
on your graph paper.  Show your work in finding
$\Delta(R^2)$ in the space provided here. \\
\vspace*{2cm} \\
\noindent Is this linear? \\
\vspace*{1cm} \\
\noindent Find the slope of the best 
line fit to the data. Use bounding lines to obtain the uncertainty in the 
slope.  {\bf Show all your work in the space provided below}. \\
\vspace*{8cm} \\

\subsubsection{Least Squares}
\item Now use linear least squares to obtain the slope with uncertainty. Note 
that $R^2$ is the {\it dependent} variable; you'll need to fill the following
table. Observe that there are two extra rows in it. One is for the units and
one is for the sums of the elements of each column. 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\multicolumn{8}{|c|}{Least Squares Method}\\
\hline 
  $V_i$ & $R_i^2$ & $\Delta (R_i^2)$ & $\frac{1}{(\Delta (R_i^2) )^2}$ &
$\frac{V_i}{(\Delta (R_i^2) )^2}$ & $\frac{R_i^2}{(\Delta (R_i^2) )^2}$ & 
$\frac{V_i^2}{(\Delta (R_i^2) )^2}$ & 
$\frac{V_i R_i^2}{(\Delta (R_i^2) )^2}$ \\
\hline
 & &  &  &  &  &  &  \\
\hline
 & &  &  &  &  &  &  \\
\hline
 & &  &  &  &  &  &  \\
\hline
 & &  &  &  &  &  &  \\
\hline
 & &  &  &  &  &  &  \\
\hline
 & &  &  &  &  &  &  \\
\hline
 & &  &  &  &  &  &  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center} 
\vfill
\newpage
\ \\
\noindent Now compute the sums required to find the slope, a, and
the uncertainty in slope, $\Delta$a, as in your lab manual. \\
\vfill
\pagebreak

\noindent How does the least squares result compare
with that obtained by hand? Comment on agreement (within uncertainty), the
relative uncertainties in each result, and anything else you think is 
important.  \\
\vspace*{3cm} \\

\item Use equation~(\ref{eq:1st:elect}) to calculate the charge-to-mass ratio
of the electron, $e/m$, from the value of $B$ and each of the slopes you 
obtained with uncertainty. Note that the accepted value of $e/m=1.758~819~62(53)\cdot 10^{11}$ C/kg \\
